# Credit Card Promotion Analysis Report

# 1. Objective:
The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate if there&#39;s a significant difference in the amounts spent
by cardholders who received the reduced interest rate ad compared to those who received the standard
seasonal ad.

# 2. Hypothesis Setting:
Before conducting any statistical test, we set our hypotheses.
 Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the amounts spent between the two groups.
 Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the amounts spent between
the two groups.
We then set the level of significance (LoS) and define the test statistic. The most common levels of
significance are 5% and 1%. We defined the rejection criteria as rejecting H0 if the p-value is less
than 0.05.

# 3. Descriptive Statistics:
To understand the data distribution, we computed basic statistics for each group.
 Standard Ad Mean (m1): 1566.389
 Reduced Interest Ad Mean (m2): 1637.5
 Standard Ad Std Dev (s1): 346.673
 Reduced Interest Ad Std Dev (s2): 356.7032

= 2.2604 (P-value=
0.02422635)

Where n1 and n2 are the number of customers in the standard and reduced interest group,
respectively.

# 4. Inferential Statistics:
A t-test was conducted to determine if there&#39;s a statistically significant difference in the amounts spent
between the two groups. The resulting p-value was 0.02422635.

# 5. Interpretation:
Based on the p-value from the t-test:
1. The p-value is less than 0.05 (assuming a 5% significance level), so we reject the null
hypothesis. This means there&#39;s a significant difference in the amounts spent between the two
groups.

2. The difference in means between the two groups is statistically significant, with the reduced
interest rate ad group spending more on average.

# Conclusion:
Statistically, there is a significant difference in the amounts spent by cardholders who received the
reduced interest rate ad compared to those who received the standard seasonal ad. This conclusion is
based on our p-value being less than the 5% significance level.
From a practical standpoint, the reduced interest rate promotion appears to have a different effect on
spending compared to the standard seasonal ad. The company should consider the magnitude of this
difference (effect size) to determine if the promotion is practically significant. If the difference in
spending is substantial, the reduced interest rate promotion might be a more effective strategy to
encourage spending among cardholders.

# Recommendation:
Given the statistical evidence, the retail department store might consider using the reduced interest
rate promotion more widely or further investigating the factors that made it effective. However, it&#39;s
also essential to consider other business metrics, like profitability, to ensure the promotion is
beneficial overall.

# Further Analysis:
While the t-test provides evidence of a difference, it would be beneficial to further analyze the data.
For instance, understanding the distribution of spending within each group, considering other external
factors that might have influenced spending, or conducting follow-up experiments can provide a more
comprehensive view of the promotion&#39;s impact.

# 6. Visual Analysis:
Visualizations below show the distribution and spread of the data. Histograms for both the standard ad
and reduced interest ad, as well as boxplots comparing the amounts spent for both promotions.

# 7. Final Thoughts:
Based on the results of the t-test, there&#39;s evidence to suggest the effectiveness of the reduced interest
rate ad compared to the standard seasonal ad. However, while statistical significance can indicate a
difference between groups, it does not necessarily imply practical significance. The magnitude of the
difference (effect size) and its business implications should be considered.
