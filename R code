# 1. Objective:We want to evaluate if there's a significant difference 
in the amounts spent by cardholders who received the reduced interest rate ad compared 
to those who received the standard seasonal ad.

# 2. Hypothesis Setting:
Before conducting any statistical test, we need to set our hypotheses.
These are the steps involved in hypothesis testing:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the amounts spent between the two groups.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the amounts spent between
the two groups.
Then we set the level of significance (LoS) (Reject region) and define the test statistic
We used a 5% level of significance
Define the rejection criteria (reject H0 if p-value<-0.05)
Decision
conclusion
# 3. Descriptive Statistics:
Compute basic statistics for each group to understand the data distribution.

# Assuming the data is loaded in a dataframe named 'data'
standard_ad <- subset(data, insert == 0)$dollars
reduced_interest_ad <- subset(data, insert == 1)$dollars

# Mean
cat("Standard Ad Mean:", mean(standard_ad), "\n")
cat("Reduced Interest Ad Mean:", mean(reduced_interest_ad), "\n")

# Median
cat("Standard Ad Median:", median(standard_ad), "\n")
cat("Reduced Interest Ad Median:", median(reduced_interest_ad), "\n")

# Standard Deviation
cat("Standard Ad Std Dev:", sd(standard_ad), "\n")
cat("Reduced Interest Ad Std Dev:", sd(reduced_interest_ad), "\n")

# 4. Inferential Statistics:
Conduct a t-test to determine if there's a statistically significant difference in the amounts spent between the two groups.

t_test_result <- t.test(standard_ad, reduced_interest_ad)
print(t_test_result)
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value

cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")
# 5. Interpretation:
  Based on the p-value from the t-test:
  
 (1) If p-value < 0.05 (assuming a 5% significance level), we reject the null 
  hypothesis and conclude that there's a significant difference in the amounts spent between the two groups.
 (2) If p-value >= 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there's no significant difference in the amounts spent between the two groups.
Conclusion:
  
  Statistical Significance: Based on the t-test, there is a statistically significant difference 
in the amounts spent by cardholders who received the reduced interest rate ad compared to those who 
received the standard seasonal ad. This is because our p-value is less than the 5% significance level.

Practical Implication: The reduced interest rate promotion appears to have a different effect 
on spending compared to the standard seasonal ad. The company should consider the magnitude of 
this difference (effect size) to determine if the promotion is practically significant.
If the difference in spending is substantial, the reduced interest rate promotion might be 
a more effective strategy to encourage spending among cardholders.

##Recommendation: Given the statistical evidence, the retail department store might consider 
using the reduced interest rate promotion more widely or further investigating the factors 
that made it effective. However, it's also essential to consider other business metrics, like 
profitability, to ensure the promotion is beneficial overall.

Further Analysis: While the t-test provides evidence of a difference, it would be beneficial to further 
analyze the data. For instance, understanding the distribution of spending within each group, 
considering other external factors that might have influenced spending, or conducting follow-up 
experiments can provide a more comprehensive view of the promotion's impact.##

# 6. Visual Analysis:
  Visualize the data to get a better understanding of the distribution and spread.

# Histograms
hist(standard_ad, main="Histogram for Standard Ad", col=rgb(0.2,0.8,0.5,0.5), xlim=c(min(data$dollars), max(data$dollars)))
hist(reduced_interest_ad, main="Histogram for Reduced Interest Ad", col=rgb(0.8,0.2,0.5,0.5), xlim=c(min(data$dollars), max(data$dollars)))

# Boxplots
boxplot(standard_ad, reduced_interest_ad, names=c("Standard Ad", "Reduced Interest Ad"), main="Boxplot of Amounts Spent")
# 7. Conclusion:
  Based on the results of the t-test and the visual analysis, draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of the reduced interest rate ad compared to the standard seasonal ad.

Remember, while statistical significance can indicate whether there's a difference between groups, it doesn't necessarily imply practical significance. The magnitude of the difference (effect size) and its business implications should also be considered.

This comprehensive analysis will provide the analyst with a clear understanding of the impact of the credit card promotion.
